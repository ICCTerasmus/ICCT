    "\n",
    "There are two video demonstrations available. The first one presents the water level control system ([view on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEZxOWY4RtU)) and the second one the Fast Fourier Transform ([view on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M28kAsWAP8o)).\n",

    "Exam can be taken after a Mentor has prepared and released an exam. Once this is done, you have to fetch the exam and provide the answers (see [this tutorial](https://www.iorad.com/player/1645114/ICCT-Platform--for-students----How-to-fetch-an-exam-and-provide-answers-?#trysteps-1) for the instructions). Once you have successfully submitted your answers, you have to wait for a Mentor to collect all the submissions, grade them and generate the feedback. Once this is done you will be able to obtain and inspect Mentor's feedback (see [this tutorial](https://www.iorad.com/player/1652160/ICCT-Platform--for-students----How-to-obtain-and-inspect-feedback-?#trysteps-1) for the instructions).\n",

Then, you have to wait for the exam to end, so that you can collect all submissions, autograde them and generate feedback for Students (see [this tutorial](https://www.iorad.com/player/1652148/ICCT-Platform--for-mentors----How-to-collect-submissions--autograde-them-and-release-feedback-?#trysteps-1) for more information).

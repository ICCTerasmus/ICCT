--- How the ICCT platform works? ---

1. Open the folder ICCT and then click on "Table-of-Contents-ICCT.ipynb".

2. A table of contents will open up. Click on the selected example to open it.

3. Click "Cell - Run All" to run the example.

4. Interact with the example and when you finish click "File - Close and Halt". Memory limit (500 MB) is namely enforced for a distinct user; it is therefore necessary to close and halt an example when finished in order to free up memory.
